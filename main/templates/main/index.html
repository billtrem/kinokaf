    <h2>About Kinokaf</h2>
    <p>
        Kinokaf is a pop-up cinema and cultural space created by filmmaker
        <strong>Will Tremlett</strong> and artist <strong>Nadia Gillard</strong>.
        Together they combine years of community cinema programming, creative practice,
        and warm hospitality to build a place where film, conversation, coffee, and culture meet.
    </p>

    <p>
        The name <strong>“Kino”</strong> is a widely used European term for independent or 
        arthouse cinemas — small, characterful places dedicated to storytelling, ideas, 
        and gathering. <strong>“Kaf”</strong> nods to café-bar culture: relaxed, social, 
        welcoming, and woven into daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kinokaf blends these two worlds: an intimate arthouse-style screening experience
        with the atmosphere of a neighbourhood café-bar. As a travelling pop-up,
        we bring film, books, music, and community vibes to towns, villages, and
        unexpected spaces — wherever the story needs to go.

    <p>
        Our café-bar offers excellent coffee, homemade cakes, craft beers, natural wines, 
        and simple, comforting food.

        Our growing collection of books spans film, art, radical politics, poetry, fiction,

    <p>
