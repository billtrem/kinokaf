    <h2>What is Kinokaf?</h2>
    <p>
        Kinokaf is a temporary pop-up film café, bar and micro-cinema currently in
        development for an undisclosed location in Aberystwyth. The project is designed
        as a six month pilot, during which we aim to test the idea, shape the space with
        the community, and begin building a business plan for a potential long-term venue.
    </p>

    <p>
        We work with spaces in a simple and flexible way, using second-hand furniture,
        warm lighting and a relaxed DIY approach to create an inviting place to spend
        time. Kinokaf is intended to feel calm during the day, sociable in the evening,
        and always centred around film and culture.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the details of the final site are still being discussed, our goal is
        to offer Aberystwyth a creative hub where cinema, coffee, reading, music and
        conversation all live together.
    </p>

    <h2>Cinema</h2>
    <p>
        Kinokaf will feature a dedicated cinema area with a large screen and digital
        projection. Films will run throughout our opening hours, from the moment we
        open until the time we close. Screenings will use Smoovie, our automated cinema
        system developed in Wales, which lets us create a smooth, high quality viewing
        experience without heavy technical setup.
    </p>

    <p>
        The programme will include independent cinema, documentaries, world films,
        Welsh storytelling, cult picks, shorts and themed seasons. We want the cinema
        to feel informal, intimate and welcoming, the kind of room where discovering
        a new film feels special.
    </p>

    <h2>Café and Bar</h2>
    <p>
        During the day, Kinokaf will operate as a relaxed café serving good coffee,
        soft drinks and space for reading, meeting and working. As evening arrives,
        it becomes a small and friendly bar offering a short list of beers, wines
        and simple food such as toasties and pastries.
    </p>

    <p>
        The intention is to keep things straightforward and comfortable without the
        need for a full kitchen. The atmosphere comes from people, music, film and a
        space that feels easy to be in.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Library</h2>
    <p>
        We plan to include a small film themed library made up of DVDs, world cinema,
        cult classics, documentaries, film books and related titles. Visitors will be
        able to browse the shelves and borrow items through a simple loan system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time the collection will grow through donations, new acquisitions and
        curated selections connected to the cinema programme. The aim is to create a
        gentle, accessible resource for anyone interested in film and the wider arts.
    </p>

    <h2>Gigs and Live Events</h2>
    <p>
        Kinokaf will also host occasional small scale live events including music,
        spoken word, open mic nights, discussions and workshops. The idea is to offer
        a platform for local creativity in an intimate setting where audiences and
        performers are close to one another.
    </p>

    <h2>The Pilot</h2>
    <p>
        This project is being developed as a low impact six month pilot. The aim is
        to activate an unused space, understand the local appetite for a film café,
        gather real data on attendance and café use, and explore whether a permanent
        version could be sustainable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Plans are ongoing and the final details will be shared once the location and
        timeline are confirmed. If the pilot is successful, we hope to work toward a
        long term cultural venue shaped around film, hospitality, reading and community.
